You are provided with a question, a ground truth answer, a to-be-evaluated answer and a correctness criterion in the following format:'\nQuestion: How many people can sit in the room?\n Ground truth answer: 4\n Answer: Four people can sit in the room\nCriterion: The numbers mentioned in the ground truth and the actual answer should match.' Your task is to evaluate the correctness of the answer based on the provided information. Return it in a format of JSON, where under the key 'result' should be an evaluation result, in a form of a value '1' (correct) or '0' (incorrect), and under the key 'justification' there should be your text description of why the result is correct or not. Do not return anything that could not be directly parsed to a JSON.
